[TextBlock(text="For DRF (Django Rest Framework) + Vue software automation with a focus on continuous creation based on user feedback, I'd recommend the following orchestration pattern:\n\n1. Feedback Collector Agent:\n   - Continuously monitors user interactions and feedback\n   - Aggregates and categorizes feedback data\n   - Sends structured feedback to the Insight Distiller\n\n2. Insight Distiller Agent:\n   - Analyzes aggregated feedback using NLP and ML techniques\n   - Identifies patterns and potential feature requests\n   - Generates structured insights for new APIs, components, and models\n   - Passes distilled insights to the Code Generator\n\n3. Code Generator Agent:\n   - Receives distilled insights from the Insight Distiller\n   - Utilizes existing templates to generate:\n     a. DRF API endpoints and serializers\n     b. Vue.js components and views\n     c. Django database models\n   - Sends generated code to the Integration Manager\n\n4. Integration Manager Agent:\n   - Receives generated code from the Code Generator\n   - Integrates new code with existing codebase\n   - Manages dependencies and ensures compatibility\n   - Triggers automated tests and passes to the Testing Orchestrator\n\n5. Testing Orchestrator Agent:\n   - Coordinates unit, integration, and end-to-end tests\n   - Analyzes test results and provides feedback\n   - If tests pass, sends to Deployment Manager; if not, returns to Integration Manager\n\n6. Deployment Manager Agent:\n   - Manages the deployment pipeline\n   - Coordinates with CI/CD tools\n   - Performs staged rollouts (dev, staging, production)\n   - Monitors post-deployment performance and stability\n\n7. Documentation Generator Agent:\n   - Automatically generates and updates API documentation\n   - Creates user guides for new frontend components\n   - Updates database schema documentation\n\n8. Feedback Loop Analyzer Agent:\n   - Monitors the impact of newly deployed features\n   - Compares user feedback before and after changes\n   - Provides insights to the Insight Distiller for continuous improvement\n\nOrchestration Flow:\n1. Feedback Collector constantly gathers user input\n2. Insight Distiller processes feedback and generates feature ideas\n3. Code Generator creates new code based on insights\n4. Integration Manager incorporates new code into the existing system\n5. Testing Orchestrator ensures quality and functionality\n6. Deployment Manager rolls out approved changes\n7. Documentation Generator keeps docs up-to-date\n8. Feedback Loop Analyzer assesses the impact of changes\n\nThis pattern enables a continuous, automated cycle of improvement based on user feedback, leveraging your existing templates to rapidly create and deploy new features across your DRF and Vue.js stack.", type='text')]
